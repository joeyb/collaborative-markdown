# collaborative-markdown

A collaborative Markdown editor built on Derby.js.

The goal of this project was to build a simple proof-of-concept that takes advantage of [Derby.js](http://derbyjs.com/)'s
(via [ShareJS](http://sharejs.org/)) [Operational Transformation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation)
support to build a Google Docs-style collaborative editor based on Markdown.

There is some cleanup/styling work that would need to be done to turn this into a real production-quality app, but
as-is the editor functionality works and all documents are automatically saved.

There is a demo hosted here: http://boiling-ocean-9398.herokuapp.com/
